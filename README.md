<p align = "justify">
This paper focuses on developing a robot which is used to clean the inner side of
pipes automatically with one operator in covid-19 situation. Cleaning inner part of pipes which
carry water, gas, oil and other fluids is a challenging task and need to be addressed very
effectively. Scales develop inside the pipes not only block the flow but sometimes become
dangerous. Normally this process is done manually with more labors of municipal
corporations. In covid-19 situation with extended lock down and less labors, pipe cleaning is
considered as non-essential. We have designed a pipe cleaning robot using Arduino and
ultrasonic sensor which can clean the scales and easily come out of the pipe also. This
automated robot can calculate the distance inside the pipe using a sensor and can direct itself
inside till the end. It has a rotor at the top which would clean the pipe with the brushes and remove
all the dirt too. The uses of the bot are in such pipes where the human hand cannot reach and
clean the pipes. The robot can be used to clean different diameter pipes. The shaft of the bot can
be adjusted according to the diameter of the pipe. This makes the robot for cleaning multidimensional pipes in an automatic and effective way
